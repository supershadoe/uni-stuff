The universe has a beginning, but no end.
Infinite.
The stars, too, have a beginning,
but their own power leads to their destruction.
Finite.
History dictates that it is
the wise who are most foolish.
One could call this a final warning from God,
to those who can still resist.

In the beginning, there was no beginning.

Or rather, our conception of “beginning” fails when applied to the universe itself. Time, as we understand it—a linear sequence of moments ticking forward from past to present to future—is a property of the universe, not something outside it. Asking what came before the Big Bang is like asking what’s north of the North Pole. It’s not that the question is absurd—it’s just that the answer lies outside the framework the question assumes.

The Big Bang was not an explosion in space; it was an expansion of space. At its earliest moments, the universe existed as a singularity—a point of infinite density and temperature where the known laws of physics cease to operate in meaningful ways. General relativity describes the behavior of massive objects and the curvature of spacetime, while quantum mechanics governs the probabilistic world of subatomic particles. But at the singularity, these two frameworks clash. We need a theory of quantum gravity to bridge them—a unifying theory that has eluded physicists for decades.

As the universe expanded and cooled, fundamental forces began to differentiate. Gravity separated from the unified force. Then the strong nuclear force split, followed by the electroweak force dividing into the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces. These transitions, governed by symmetry breaking, were not chaotic but patterned. The universe obeys deep mathematical principles, even in its most chaotic appearances.

Eventually, atoms formed, followed by stars, galaxies, planets—and life. But all of this is a tiny ripple in the vast timeline of cosmic history. The light from the most distant galaxies takes billions of years to reach us, revealing the universe as it was—not as it is now. Looking out in space is also looking back in time.

And time itself? It’s not absolute. Einstein’s theory of relativity showed that time is affected by speed and gravity. A clock on a satellite ticks slightly faster than one on Earth. At the edge of a black hole, time can nearly stop. These aren’t thought experiments—they are measurable phenomena. Time, space, energy, and matter are inextricably linked in a four-dimensional fabric we call spacetime.

Yet we are not mere spectators. We are the universe becoming aware of itself. Through science, we peel back layers of reality, revealing not just how the universe works, but why its laws seem so precisely tuned for complexity—and perhaps for consciousness.

If the universe has no boundary, no edge, then it may have no beginning or end. Time might be like the surface of the Earth: finite but unbounded. And in such a model, the universe would contain all possibilities, constrained only by the laws that give it form.

So, when we ask, “Why is there something rather than nothing?” we are not just asking a scientific question—we are standing at the edge of knowledge and staring into the mystery of existence itself.
